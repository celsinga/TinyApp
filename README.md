# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node.js and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
It allows users to register with their emails and a password, and store their URLs in an index they can access.
Passwords are hashed and cookies are encrypted.
